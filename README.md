This site is by no means the definitive guide to backbone.js and all corrections and contributions are welcome.

About Backbone Tutorials:

As single page apps and large scale javascript applications become more prominent on the web, useful resources for those developers who are jumping the ship are crucial.

I started this site to not only consolidate my understanding of backbone.js, but to also document what I have learned thus far for myself and others.

## BackboneJS Courses

Backbone.js enforces that communication to the server should be done entirely through a RESTful API.  Backbone.JS Course. This is because the browser is no longer the only client, we now have mobile devices, tablet devices, Google Goggles and electronic fridges etc. If you read through some of the beginner tutorials the benefits will soon become self evident and due to Backbone.js light nature you can incrementally include it in any current or future projects.
